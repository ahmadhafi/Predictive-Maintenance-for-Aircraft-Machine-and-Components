# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Aircraft-Machine-and-Components
This Repository Contain Supervised Machine Learning model for Predicting Remaining Useful Lifetime(RUL) to predict which machine should be replace or need Maintenance to Prevent the Machine Failure and Error, this Model use LSTM (Long Short-tem Memory) model, which need 2 type of datasets first we need Training dataset and Testing datasets, This Predictor use Time-series Forecasting
this is the project for Internship at PT Garuda Maintenance Facility and to Complete My grade in PKL (Praktek Kerja Lapangan) as a Report for University
